# Emotion-enabled YouTube Demo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AngelAlvie/youtube-demo.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.org/AngelAlvie/youtube-demo)

This demo uses Affectiva's JavaScript SDK to analyze your emotions as you watch a YouTube video. Search a YouTube video by keyword or enter its URL, and with your webcam turned on, you'll be able to see your emotions both during the video and during playback. The code is written entirely in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. [d3](https://d3js.org/) was used to render the emotions graph.
